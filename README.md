# üîê Password Strength Checker

This is a simple **GUI-based Password Strength Checker** built with Python's `tkinter` library. The application evaluates the strength of a user's password based on length, character diversity, and whether it appears in a list of commonly used passwords.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Checks for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters  
- üìè Evaluates password length with increasing score for longer passwords  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warns if password is found in a list of common passwords (`common.txt`)  
- üìä Scores password from 0 to 7 and classifies it as:
  - Weak  
  - Okay  
  - Good  
  - Strong  
- üñ•Ô∏è GUI built with `tkinter` for ease of use

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The checker evaluates your password based on:

### 1. Length:
- +1 point for > 8 characters  
- +1 for > 12  
- +1 for > 16  
- +1 for > 20  

### 2. Character Types:
- +1 if it includes more than 1 type  
- +1 if it includes more than 2 types  
- +1 if it includes all 4 types (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special)

**Score: 0‚Äì7**  
- 0‚Äì3: Weak  
- 4: Okay  
- 5‚Äì6: Good  
- 7: Strong
